Natanel Nisenbaum

Professional Summary: I am a data-driven, analytical, and curious
Master’s student in Business Analytics & Data Science at IE University
in Madrid. I am building my career at the intersection of business,
data, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy turning messy data into
structured insights and practical solutions, especially when analytics
and AI can directly support real business decisions.

I am originally from a small town near Jerusalem in Israel. I completed
an exchange semester in Bogotá, Colombia, and I currently live in
Madrid. I am a dual German–Israeli national and thrive in multicultural,
international environments.

I am particularly passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning. I am especially interested in understanding how models move
from experimentation in notebooks to real-world application and
measurable business impact.
